### You've reached a point where you're free to choose which emulator you would like to use. AMD and Intel are fine on both emulators as they have MESA drivers, and Nvidia is also fine with either emulator.

Now, you're left with a choice. You can choose to use Ryujinx or Yuzu. If you know what you're really looking for, then you can skip everything and go straight to the choice.

Still unsure? Here's reasons to use Ryujinx over Yuzu:
- Better stability
- Better compatibility
- A higher accuracy
- Amiibo support
- Has LDN functionality (which is irrelevant with the choices you've chose)

Here's reasons to use Yuzu over Ryujinx: 
- Runs slightly better, especially on lower end hardware
- Has multiple rendering APIs in the main build
