# SwitchEmuGuide
## Hello! If you're here, you're either looking to setup a switch emulator or just testing it out for fun. PLEASE READ EVERYTHING BEFORE SKIPPING TO THE SELECTION!!!
### (No matter your use case, I hope this is of some use)
Before you begin, we recommend you have a CPU newer than 2013. CPUs that are older may suffer from *severe* performance issues. To keep it simple, older CPUs don't support instruction sets that are important for fast switch emulation. (You can still try, but there's no promises it will run great)

* * *

This will ask you through a multitude of questions to decide if you need yuzu or ryujinx. Then send you to a guide that can help you get set up.

This guide is still being made. If you're willing to contribute, make sure it's organised like how I've written the folders. Any help is majorly appreciated, especially for new updates or even translating the guide into another language

Now, for some questions
